What is Vrobo?
Vrobo offers two core services designed for e-commerce businesses:

Order Confirmation
Vrobo confirms orders with customers before they are shipped to reduce failed deliveries.

Shipping Validation
Vrobo verifies the feedback provided by shipping companies when orders are marked as undelivered (e.g. rejected by the customer). We check directly with the customer to confirm whether the rejection is real or not.

How Vrobo Works
To achieve accurate confirmation and validation, Vrobo follows a multi-step process:

Robo-IVR Robo Calls
We make up to 3 trials of automated calls with personalized voice messages tailored to the brand and situation.

WhatsApp Messaging
If the calls are unanswered, we send WhatsApp messages and use AI to analyze the customerâ€™s response.

Fallback to SMS
If WhatsApp fails, we send an SMS.

Final Attempt via Email
If SMS is unsuccessful, we send an email.

Integration & Notifications
Vrobo automatically updates order status on platforms like Shopify, WordPress, and others.

Merchants are notified of customer responses and any detected fake shipping updates. We may also notify shipping companies if applicable.

If the customer updates their contact details or address, Vrobo passes that info back to the merchant and, when applicable, to the shipping company.
